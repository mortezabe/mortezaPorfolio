            The most fundamental question about the necessity of music history
            is not whether we need history to understand the origins of our
            practices today. The answer to this question usually constitutes of
            a large number of musical terms and ideas that we know and use today
            or is reflected in our practice that is somehow connected to a
            certain historical period. One can show how our understanding and
            treatment of melody, harmony and other musical elements are rooted
            in those historical periods. The foundational question here is one
            step deeper: why do we need that historical information or why do we
            need to be informed about the historical roots of our current ideas
            and practice?

          <p>
            The above question, if answered locally, is not difficult. For
            example, one can justify the significance of music history through
            the significance of stylistic knowledge for performers to perform
            pieces from the past (and even contemporary works) in the ‘right’
            manner. Performers’ understanding of musical style can enrich their
            understanding of the way different elements are treated in different
            historical periods which makes the performance of musical works
            sound informed and true to their historical contexts. But when it
            comes to the question of music history in itself, i.e., why we need
            any kind of historical awareness about music in the first place, the
            question is more challenging. My suggestion is that one response to
            this question could focus not on the way in which music history can
            improve our understanding of the past, but how it is an integral
            part of understanding our present. The notion of ‘concept’ is
            crucial here. Learning about music history makes us aware of areas
            in the musical thought that we would not be aware of, and we would
            not see it without the historical knowledge. For example, a history
            of Western music makes us aware of the gradual accumulation of sonic
            and intellectual ideas or components that together have constructed
            the sound we call music and our understanding of it. Understanding
            both the objective and conceptual structure of music and how it has
            developed throughout history makes us aware of possible assumptions,
            certain premises, and in general ideas associated with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This historical approach can be a powerful way to make the music we
            hear and our hearing of it more relevant to who we are. We learn
            that for example experiencing music as something spiritual or
            otherworldly or as an art completely non-material and abstract must
            be seen in the background of the historical construction of music as
            the world harmony especially in the pre-1800 conceptual map. For
            example, the roots of musical abstraction, as secular as it may
            sound, might be traced back to a religious view of what music is and
            what kind of relationship it has with the material world and the
            influence that musical practice of such a view has had on music as
            an object and a concept. This might simply show that the current
            commonplace notion of music as a non-material art (the
            protoformalist view of music) is conditioned and made possible
            through certain historical developments in music history: the role
            of music in the church; expressionist movement of the 17th century;
            the quasi-religious approach of the early 19th century Romanticism,
            etc. In this respect, the study of music history could provide us
            with the grounds in which a current conception of music has been
            formed especially in cases where the links or connections between
            them are not clear.
