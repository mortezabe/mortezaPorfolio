            Why does music matter? Music Matters for many reasons some of them
            are the reasons we share with one another (let’s call them more
            universal reasons) and some of them are personal reasons that make
            music specifically significant for each of us. However, there is one
            reason that I think can connect all of us to music. The reason I’m
            interested in can to some extent explain what is there in music that
            makes its experience an integral part of our lives. A general
            formulation of that reason is: music connects us to something beyond
            our specific individual beings, and I think that’s also the source
            of joy in music. In other words, there is something in music that
            connects the moment of listening to music to something beyond that
            moment, the individual listening to music to something beyond the
            individual; that could explain why in those moments when musical
            experience dominates our being in the world, everything else seems
            to be trivial, seems to be unimportant and insignificant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of a time when you were listening to music and you felt you
            want to cry or you actually cried or you felt so much joy or so much
            sorrow or so much of some other particular type of feeling inside
            you that made you feel you were outside that particular
            circumstance, that is outside the time and place. We sometimes
            describe it as moments of ecstasy or moments of contemplation or
            immersing ourselves in an experience. That moment is related, among
            other things, to some degree of abstraction that is usually ascribed
            to music—in one way or another. Whether we think that music is a
            purely abstract art—which includes these mysterious sonic forms that
            move and play around without meaning anything causing pleasure in us
            only by giving us the chance to follow the motion of these sonic
            beings—or we believe that music is a representational art that
            speaks to us says something, the most important thing here is that
            by listening to music we can never agree to some pre-given ideas
            that are being expressed in music. The very fact that
            notwithstanding any interpretation we have of a piece, we always
            consider some degree of validity for other understandings and feel
            less biased than when we encounter a different interpretation of a
            poem, let’s say, shows that we never have any solid referential
            grounds for proving other interpretations wrong.
          </p>

            Music, in this sense, offers a unique and quite exceptional
            intellectual/emotional democracy which doesn’t even exist in
            abstract paintings. That democracy emerges from the freedom inherent
            in music, that is exactly what connects us to something beyond us as
            particular beings. If music had a particular meaning like the way
            language does (we all know that even sometimes languages doesn’t
            easily contain fixed and given meanings), then music would have
            never been able to make us feel disconnected from the particular
            moment we are living in. Music’s very power of ‘distraction’,
            reflected in the way we transcend or in a sense ‘unhear’ the world
            we that we are in, is the same force that turns the experience of
            listening to music a path for connecting to something beyond our
            particularity. It’s an invitation to being universal, and communal.
            In this manner, musical abstraction is equally political.
