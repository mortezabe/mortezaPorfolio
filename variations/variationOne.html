          <p>
            Music has the power to distract you from everyday life so much so
            that you could put yourself in danger. This is best captured in
            Odysseus: “Odysseus and the sirens. Book 12 of Homer’s 13 Odyssey
            emphasizes the overwhelming power of music, both for good and for
            ill. The sirens—part woman, part bird—sing so beautifully that
            seafarers forget all worldly concerns and die when their ships
            strike the nearby rocks. To succumb to the beauty of music means to
            turn one’s back on life. “But if you wish to listen,” Circe tells
            Odysseus, “let the men tie you . . . hand and foot, back to the
            mast, lashed to the mast, so you may hear those harpies’ thrilling
            voices; shout as you will, begging to be untied, your crew must only
            twist more line around you and keep their stroke up, till the
            singers fade.” As his crew members continue to row with beeswax in
            their ears, Odysseus gains wisdom by hearing the sirens’ song, all
            the while straining against and begging to be freed from the ropes.”
            (Mark Evan Bonds)

            Concert hall, which is apparently a place to worship music in a
            temple like situation, is indeed the imprisonment of music's power.
            It controls music and makes sure it stays away from society. The
            segregation of life and music and the danger that music has for the
            human being continues to be a determining factor in keeping music
            under control, whether in church or court or in concert hall. The
            musical life is dangerous to human being as music is in its nature
            against life. While music cannot be reduced to abstract sounds and
            it has strong social and cultural functions, it has always been
            perceived as an abstract art or an art with powerful abstract or
            otherworldly nature, and it is exactly this abstract and
            otherworldly layers of music that could turn into forces that run
            against the sociality of life.
