          In Hossein Alizadeh’s setting of Hafez’s most well-known masnavi, a
          tasnīf titled “āhuye vahshī” (“wild Gazelle”), there is a moment where
          the soft, and almost carefree coy of rāst-panjgāh mode suddenly shifts
          to an intense moment of the mode shūshtarī. This occurs when after the
          hopeful expression of a wish for the entrance of Khezr—who has a magic
          solution to any barren desert—the poet remembers those who did not
          survive this disastrous situation and asks us to recall their memories
          by “accompanying the raining clouds”, that is by crying. The
          instrumentalists respond to this moment by turning the emotional
          content of the opening motifs inside out when the same motifs return
          in the varied nostalgic mode of shūshtarī. [more description here!!!]
          مگر خضر مبارک پی درآید / ز یمن همتش کاری گشاید به یاد رفتگان و
          دوستداران / موافق گرد با ابر بهاران Alizadeh, more than anywhere else
          though, demonstrates the expressive power of the dastgāh he has chosen
          for his selected verses of Hāfez’s poem where the music returns to
          rāst-panjgāh. This musical moment highlights the complex feeling of
          the verse in which Hafez combines the sorrowful expression of
          separation by using the simile of “blade/sword” and quickly shifting
          into the sarcastic and bitterly humorous complaint of the unfair
          treatment of the friendship: “translation of ….” چنان بیرحم زد تیغ
          جدایی / که گویی خود نبوده‌ست آشنایی The first mesrā (hemistich) is set
          to the peak of shūshtarī’s expressive force completed by the opening
          phrase of the second mesrā, before the last syllable of “nabūdast”
          (“has not been”) returns the mood/mode to the playful melodic formula
          of rāst-panjgāh with its quick tahrīr (melisma) on a stepwise
          descending fourth to the khātemeh (final) on the final syllable of the
          word “āshnāī” (“acquaintance”). This is the same word we heard at the
          end of the first verse with the same musical setting: in the first
          verse it was rhyming with the question “kojāī?” (“where are you?”) and
          now with “separation.” The same setting not only remembers but also
          confirms the acquaintance with the “wild gazelle,” the beautiful
          beloved who has run away. Here, we see that the problem is not
          probably the wild gazelle who has decided to run away but the nature
          that is not green any longer. One must cry to compensate for the lack
          of rain which has caused the separation. The final verse, being set to
          a triumphant musical closure, hints at some kind of hope. It is a
          strange kind of hope though: it invites us to perfume our soul with
          the “aroma of hope” eternally! The resonance of the word “eternally”
          with the high final note is transient, just as the fragrance of hope
          is probably transient. Seemingly paradoxical, it is only through the
          fragrance as well as sonic memory that one has to keep the hope, a
          subtle observation about the psychological conditions of Iranians in
          two completely separate yet perceived similar historical contexts
          seven centuries apart. The realist relationship between text and music
          is not limited to the above-mentioned moments. At the beginning of the
          tasnīf, the opening verse is very playful and the notes jump from here
          to there, not a common gesture in Persian music, which hints at the
          search for the āhuye vahshī. The coy and playfulness of rāst-panjgāh
          and the melodic and rhythmic language Alizadeh has chosen for this
          verse paints an image of a lover looking for his beloved as if in a
          hide-and-seek game. However, the game becomes gradually serious when
          we learn that the āhuye vahshī is probably the subject himself, a
          wanderer (just like āhuye vahshī) looking for people he has lost. Is
          the poetic voice speaking to itself?
