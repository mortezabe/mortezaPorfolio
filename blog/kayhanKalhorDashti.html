                The piece “Chärmezräb-e Dashtī” from the album Silk Road
                Journeys – When Strangers Meet is a Persian classical
                composition in the mode Avaz-e Dashti based on a theme by the
                Persian legendary tar-player Jalil Shahnaz. In this piece,
                Kayhan Kalhor, Siamak Jahangiri, and Siamak Aghaei perform
                setar, ney, and santur respectively. Although the piece stands
                within the long tradition of the chärmezräb, as a musical form
                that has the fastest tempo in Persian classical repertoire and
                is the most virtuosic piece in a program, this collaborative
                work offers a few subtly novel features that make the recording
                really outstanding. Kalhor-Jahangiri-Aghaei’s quote of really
                beautifully and somehow symmetrically built melody by Shahnaz is
                used as the refrain that all solo and collective journeys return
                to; a great celebration of the unbeatable talent of the great
                melodist, Jalil Shahnaz. (Listen to example 2, the recording
                where Shahnaz himself plays the theme in his own recording of
                his original piece.)

              </div>

              <p>
                But the trio’s take on Shahnaz’s work goes beyond a sheer
                commemoration of Shahnaz/s work and emphasizes new aspects in
                which the beauty of the rhythmic and motivic materials can be
                appreciated. It offers a new sonority in which the music is less
                melodic than colouristic. The intertwined texture of setar and
                santur are specifically outstanding and have been used in a
                pretty unique way. The setar with its ‘por’ sonority provides a
                great greyish background for the shiny metallic bells of santur
                to shine in many important moments. This is a music of colour,
                when it comes to the way melodies are used to feature tone
                colours, especially how potentials of monophonic/heterophonic
                texture are employed to build a sonorous rather than melodic
                world. Ney is performed at its highest beauty. In particular,
                the striking moment of its drone-like ‘open string’ gestures
                that translate certain santur’s hammering or setar’s hit
                techniques or the effect of violin’s bariolage gives us a
                vigorous and embodied sonority that feels quite sinuous. There
                is no percussion instrument! This is an important ‘lack’ which
                contributes to the expressiveness of the piece and fluidity of
                the rhythmic imagination, especially given that Persian tombak
                is a strongly pulse-marking instrument that is a commonplace in
                all metrical pieces.
