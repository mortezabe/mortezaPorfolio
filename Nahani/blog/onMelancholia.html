              <h5 class="subheading">
                Lars von Trier’s <em>Melancholia</em> deconstructs the concept
                of melancholy not only through the plot and cinematic
                techniques, but also through the use of Wagner’s prelude to
                <em>Tristan and Isolde</em>. The movie’s intertextual reference
                to a composition that is the epitome of the Romantic notion of
                infinite longing (<em>sehensucht</em>) expresses a hidden layer
                of melancholy that is normally concealed from common
                understanding of the term.

              Melancholy, sometimes taken as an equivalent term to depression,
              is commonly defined as being inactive and lacking desire—that is
              not feeling the demand or enthusiasm for reaching out to the world
              and using its resources for the sake of one's own pleasure. While
              the main character (Justine) of the movie is melancholic—as she
              appears to be someone who is not enjoying the sources of joy that
              are around her—her encounter with the world demonstrates a deeper
              understanding of her expectations from the world. To her, the
              human world around her, that is the socially and culturally
              conditioned space around her, is completely undesirable and her
              only response to such a world is her experience of melancholy,
              that is withdrawing from any desire or wish for the satisfaction
              of any such desire. And Justine’s apparent resignation from
              desiring is embodied in the form of a planet called the
              Melancholia.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this is all what we see on the surface: Von Trier’s
              deconstruction of melancholy through intertextual references to
              the 19th-century musical romanticism opens a space for a novel
              understanding of the mood. The movie depicts melancholy not as the
              negation of desire but as the result of an infinite, intense
              desire that cannot be satisfied in the world. Furthermore,
              melancholy as portrayed in the movie goes beyond a merely
              psychological mood or state; it becomes more of an
              <em>existential</em> condition that offers an epistemology that
              seems to be a more authentic understanding of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The movie is about a young woman who seems to be suffering from
              melancholy, living underwhelmed by some pensive dominant mood that
              has affected her life so strongly that she cannot feel happy in
              her own wedding. Right from the beginning of the movie, we learn
              that she does not like to eat or socialize. Each time she tries to
              spend time with other people (except with her nephew) she faces
              failure, as she does not receive the response she expects, which
              seems to be a mutual understanding of the condition. Alongside her
              dissatisfaction with the way others encounter the world’s tragic
              nature, there is another important theme: a planet called
              Melancholia is coming towards the Earth, which, based on the
              prediction of scientists, is going to pass by the Earth. While
              studies that show the planet is not going to hit the earth, there
              are some who think that it will hit the Earth bring about the end
              of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The effect of this situation on Justine is ironic: when gradually
              this belief of the danger that is threatening the Earth becomes
              stronger and stronger, Justine begins to feel both livelier and
              more restful. There is an obvious fast improvement in her mood.
              Although this does not mean that she does not feel the melancholy
              anymore or feels happy and excited, the melancholy that was
              torturing her from inside is replaced by an objective perception
              of the word and its condition. In a sense, her inner melancholy
              has received an outer response from the world, and this is how Von
              Trier’s definition of Melancholia goes beyond a particular
              psychological mood and becomes an epistemological position about
              the world. The objectivity of Melancholia, a fact that cannot be
              denied but can be only hoped not to occur, becomes the
              <em>right</em> perception of the world and its possible motion
              towards the end. Hence, the melancholy she feels is the
              <em>emotional expression</em> of the instinctual awareness she has
              of the fact that the Earth is being hit by an object called
              Melancholia. The threatening planet is, therefore, the embodiment
              of the mood or the feeling that Justine is experiencing. And this
              is introduced as a fundamental truth. This provides a condition
              where the mood or psychological state in which she is living
              completely fits the reality outside.

              Although Justine is not happy and she shouldn't be because she is
              melancholic and has a sad mood, there is a new layer in her
              experience of Melancholia. She finds her psychological mood the
              exact reflection of what's going on outside. What's going on
              outside in the external world corresponds to the inner feelings
              she’s experiencing. so her feeling her emotion becomes the truth
              or the true expression of the reality outside. Or, the other way
              around: the external reality becomes the real embodiment of her
              emotions. This becomes an important aspect of melancholy Justine
              is experiencing as scientists (here represented by John, who is
              Justine’s brother-in-law) could have an explanation and therefore
              a causal knowledge of the world outside but it doesn't mean that
              they can <em>feel</em> the truth of the world’s situation. This is
              why John the scientist commits suicide because he found his own
              existence only meaningful as long as the world existed: there
              needs to be a world for science to do its explanatory work;
              science is not interested in nothingness! John was able to offer
              an explanation for the world only before the world is doomed to be
              finished. There is no scientific meaning outside the world. On an
              opposing side, this is the beginning of Justine's world.

            <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2> -->
            <p>
              Justine, who was melancholic on two planes in the first half of
              the movie, is in a paradoxical—and ironic—way, a happy,
              melancholic person in the second half. The first half of the
              movie, which portrays Justine’s response to the social world
              around her represents not only her melancholic mood but also her
              anxiety as she is contextualized in an unauthentic communal life
              that does make any sense at all to her. The second half, however,
              depicts a genuine world in which her inner melancholy reflects the
              outer Melancholia. Her moods become the true reflection of the
              reality outside and she feels secure, restful, relaxed, and
              grounded in her psychological state. The whole meaning and
              intertextual references to the prelude to Wagner's Tristan and
              Isolde which dominates the sonic space of the movie from the
              beginning is its interrelation with von Trier’s deconstructed
              conception of melancholy and depression. Wagner’s famous
              composition is about desire. It is about a type of desire that is
              never fulfilled; a love or some kind of passion that does not
              receive any response in the world and the only satisfaction to it
              is death. [summary of Tristan and Isolde and concept of
              sehensucht] In Melancholia, the planet Melancholia is associated
              with desire. On the surface we think that Justine is a person
              without any desire, a bored person who cannot engage with the
              world, other people, and even objects around her. She has lost her
              appetite or ability or any capacity to enjoy and appreciate the
              tastes and beauties of the world. But we gradually come to
              understand that on the contrary she has such a powerful desire
              some kind of desire or some type of desire that cannot be
              satisfied with the ways in which the world has been defined and
              organized. The prelude is constructed of lingering dissonances and
              suspensions that never get resolved. It expresses the type of
              desire that cannot be satisfied. Wagner’s music Drama is about the
              nature of this desire; it is the sonic embodiment of unsatisfiable
              desire and this is why his music is perceived as strongly
              dramatic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The naked scene in Melancholia is definitely one of the strongest
              manifestation of this deconstruction of melancholy as a mood of
              being in the world. While because of the Melancholia’s blue light
              the entire scene is blue, the sinuous yet graceful position of
              Justine’s naked body with her subtle moves is extremely erotic and
              awakening desire, what one might think melancholy has nothing to
              do. The music is also the sonic embodiment of this unending
              sehensucht for something that cannot be reached in this world.
